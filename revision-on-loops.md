// Notes from revision on loops

All about repetition - looping around the same task.

for (inital value ; condition evaluation - loop runs whilst condition is true ; update the counter after each iteration)...

for (let rep = 1; rep <=10 ; rep++);
++ code to be repeated

rep can be any variable.
Note: we can define the start variable at any value e.g. 0, 1, 3...

Arrays

Loop through arrays - are a very common way to log elements

remember 3 steps to an array:

1. Set the counter
2. define the condition (for the loop to run)
3. define how you want the counter to update

You can read items from an array
and
You can add items into an array (2 ways set [0] or [push value])

Additional learning points on arrays

- Adding to end of array.
- Removing from end

- Adding to beginning of array.
- Removing from beginning.

** end **

===== re-call and remember these =====

&& recall barbell example...

> add to end array.push
> removing from end array.pop

e.g. array.push('john');
array.push('john','dick')

opposite - remove!!

array.pop();
removes the last item in the array.
no need to spec the item.

** beginning **

> remove from the beginning

array.shift();

> add to the beginning

array.unshift('item');

Other commonly used array methods

concat = adding 2 arrays together to create a 3rd array.

includes = does it include this??

array.includes('blue') - does any element contain blue.

indexof = tells you which index the item is at

reverse - reverse the array

Slice & spice - remember this!!!!!
