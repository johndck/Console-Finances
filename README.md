# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances | My submission

## Overview

This activity we are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file.

## Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, clone it to your computer. done ✅

2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository. done ✅

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset. done ✅

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period. done ✅

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  - (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`) done ✅

- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.done ✅

- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.done ✅

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:done ✅

```text
Financial Analysis
----------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average Change: -2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.done ✅

**Hints:**

- Remember, in order to combine strings and variables in the console you will need to use **concatenation**.

‼️ ** I used template literals instead **

- How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript? done ✅
