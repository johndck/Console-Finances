// Notes from revision on loops

All about repetition - looping around the same task.

for (inital value ; condition evaluation - loop runs whilst condition is true ; update the counter after each iteration)...

for (let rep = 1; rep <=10 ; rep++);
++ code to be repeated

rep can be any variable.
Note: we can define the start variable at any value e.g. 0, 1, 3...

Loop through arrays - are a very common way to log elements

remember 3 steps to an array:

1. Set the counter
2. define the condition (for the loop to run)
3. define how you want the counter to update

You can read items from an array
and
You can add items into an array (2 ways set [0] or [push value])
